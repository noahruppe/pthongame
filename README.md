# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{I made a mock or clone game of flappy bird that has sound effects and a character.}

{My purpose for writing this software was so that I could learn how to make a game and what the structure of a game would look like to improve my coding skills.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{The tools that helped me make this game are random and pygame they were needed as the framwork}

{with pygame I was able to create the character and the screen and the whole game really then I also needed to import random so that the pipes would be made at random at random heights.}

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to make background music in the future to improve the game experience
* I would like to improve the contact machanics I had to do a lot of tweaking to get it to recognize contact on the top and the bottom pipes but on the sides it will say you hit it even if you are just close
* I would also in the future like to increase the speed and width of the area's you pass through to make it harder.
